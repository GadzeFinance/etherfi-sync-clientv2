# Etherfi Sync Client
The Etherfi Sync Client is a tool designed to simplify the process of accessing validator keys for Node Operators who have won auctions. The client periodically queries the graph to detect any won auctions and imports the required information for validator key password, validator public key, validator key file, and a script to import the account to prysm.

## How to Use
1. Create a new folder to store the application contents.
2. Download the latest binary release from GitHub by navigating to the Etherfi Sync Client repository and selecting the appropriate release.
3. Move the binary into the folder created
4. Create a config.json file in the same folder with the following contents:
```json
{
  "GRAPH_URL": "<Dev URL>",
  "BIDDER": "<ETH Address used in the web UI to create bids>",
  "PRIVATE_KEYS_FILE_LOCATION": "<path to private key file generated by desktop app>",
  "OUTPUT_LOCATION": "<path to the folder where you want to output >",
  "PASSWORD": "<password used when generating the keys with the desktop app>",
  "IPFS_GATEWAY": "<IPFS gateway URL>"
}
```
> Note: Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your own information.
5. Run `./etherfi-sync-clientv2`
6. If any configuration values are missing, the program may prompt you to enter them.

That's it! The Etherfi Sync Client will now automatically query the graph for any won auctions and import the necessary information for prysm.
